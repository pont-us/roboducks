                 networks in the realm of modelling, identification and
                 control of nonlinear systems. The basic ideas and
                 techniques of artificial neural networks are presented
                 in language and notation familiar to control engineers.
                 Applications of a variety of neural network
                 architectures in control are surveyed. We explore the
                 links between the fields of control science and neural
                 networks in a unified presentation and identify key
                 areas for future research. (Author abstract) 196 Refs",
